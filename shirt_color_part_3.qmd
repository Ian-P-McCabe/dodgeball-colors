# Overview

In [Part 1](https://ian-p-mccabe.github.io/shirt-color-space/) and [Part 2](https://ian-p-mccabe.github.io/shirt-color-space/part_2/) we explored the issues facing the Stonewall Dodgeball league when selecting shirt colors. In Part 1 we found the best way to add additional colors to the league and in Part 2 we explored heuristics for finding the best subset of colors for the league so no two colors are too similar. 

Part 3 will expand on part 2, introducing proper optimization methods for color selection. We will begin by showing how to select the best (most diverse) colors for the league and then expand on this by taking into account team preference.

I have decided to keep all code cells hidden for this writeup, but feel free to expand any of the
codeblocks on this page (denoted by "> Code"). All the source code can be found on my GitHub. 


```{python}
import numpy
import pandas as pd
from colormath import color_objects, color_diff
import math

# This exists to resolve an issue with the colormath library 
def patch_asscalar(a):
    return a.item()
setattr(numpy, "asscalar", patch_asscalar)

color_df = pd.read_csv("data/all_colors.csv")
```

# Refresher

## There are a lot of colors!

The dodgeball league provides 103 unique shirt colors to pick from. 

Eagle eyed readers will see that there are 110 colors lsited below, however I have removed a few duplicate colors from the pool.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
lab_string = list(color_df["L*a*b Value"])
lab_strings = [color_string.split(", ") for color_string in lab_string]

lab_floats = [[float(x) for x in row] for row in lab_strings]

lab_colors = [color_objects.LabColor(lab_l=lab_color[0], lab_a=lab_color[1], lab_b=lab_color[2]) for lab_color in lab_floats]
```

## Obtaining LAB Values

In order to accurately determine color difference, we will need to obtain the LAB values for each possible shirt color. 
The LAB color system is best for this analysis because it accurately represents how humans see and differentiate color. 

![How I got LAB Color Info](./assets/ColorInfoProcess.png)

LAB color information for most colors can be obtained from the PMS (Pantone Matching System) code beneath the swatch on the color palette. 
Pantone provides LAB (and other color) information for each color with a PMS code. (For colors without a PMS code, I approximated a LAB value from the display RGB value)

## Color Difference

Once we have our LAB values, we can easily compute color difference.

For color difference calculations, will use the [CIEDE2000 distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000). Color difference is returned as a ∆E value. 


### Delta E Values and Color-Difference Perceptibility

| Delta E (ΔE) | Perceptibility | Description |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| < 1 | Imperceptible | Colors appear identical to most observers |
| 1–2 | Very Slight | Only experts notice the difference |
| 2–10 | Noticeable | Average person notices on close inspection |
| 10–20 | Obvious | Clearly different colors |
| > 20 | Very Distinct | Colors are dramatically different |

For **shirt color selection**, we will use:

- **ΔE < 5**: Risk of confusion, too similar
- **ΔE 5–10**: Acceptable if team choices are prioritized over maximum distinctness
- **ΔE > 10**: Safe choice, easily distinguishable in all conditions
- **∆E > 20**: Ideal choice, very distinct colors 

### Examples

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}

---
These two colors are **2** units apart:
```{python}
#|output: true
from utils import display_color_swatches
display_color_swatches(hex_colors=[color_df.iloc[8]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[55]['Hex']])
```
---


These two colors are **10** units apart:
```{python}
#|output: true
display_color_swatches([color_df.iloc[0]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[46]['Hex']])
```
---

These two colors are **20** units apart:
```{python}
#|output: true
display_color_swatches([color_df.iloc[1]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[68]['Hex']])
```
---

:::

::: {.g-col-6}

These two colors are **30** units apart:

```{python}
#| output: true
display_color_swatches([color_df.iloc[0]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[1]['Hex']])
```
---

And these two colors are **80** units apart:
```{python}
#| output: true
display_color_swatches([color_df.iloc[6]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[46]['Hex']])
```

# Finding the best colors

Now that we have our colors in a format we can properly analyze, we can return to answer our central question:

**What is the best set of shirt colors for the dodgeball league?**

In part 2 we covered why this isn't super easy to compute:

- Analyzing the best combinations of 16 colors yeilds **2,245,547,413,628,550,570** possible combinations! (2 quintillion)
- Analyzing the best combinations of 24 colors, we must score **178,409,928,551,259,450,861,900** possible combinations! (178 sextillion)

I framed the problem as a a subset of the Maximum Diversity Problem - how can we select the subset of colors that are most distant from each other on average?

In Part 2 we used some heuristics to try an approximate the subset of colors with the highest average distance, these included random searches, greedy algorithms, and generating a convex hull of the LAB color space. 

While these are fun approximations (especially the convex hull visual), they pale in comparison to the power of proper optimization methods. 

We will use Google's **Operations Research Tools Constraint Programming - SAT Solver** to systematically explore solutions to our color diversity problem. 

The CP-SAT solver is flexible enough to enable us to explore the original **maximum pairwise distance** approach as well as other measures such as **maximum minimum distance**.

```{python}
#| output: false
def build_distance_matrix():
  distance_matrix = {}
  for i, color1 in enumerate(lab_colors):
      for j, color2 in enumerate(lab_colors):
          if i != j:
            distance_matrix[(i, j)] = round( #Want integer values
              color_diff.delta_e_cie2000(color1=color1, color2=color2)
              )
  
  return distance_matrix
  
distance_matrix = build_distance_matrix()
```

```{python}
num_colors = 103
num_colors_to_select = 16
```

## Maximum Pairwise Distance

Continuing where we left off in part 2, lets find the subset of colors with the greatest pairwise distance. This is the same metric used in the random, greedy, and convex hull approaches. 

After letting the model run for 5 minutes, we get the following:

```{python}
#| cache: false 
#| output: true
#| eval: true 
from optimization import ColorModel
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
from utils import display_palette, adjust_hue_for_rainbow, plot_distance_heatmap

max_pairwise_model = ColorModel(num_colors, num_colors_to_select, distance_matrix)

max_pairwise_model.build_max_pairwise_model()
print(f"Variables created: {len(max_pairwise_model.color_vars)}")  # Should print 103

# Solve, use 30 secs for this example
max_pairwise_model.solve(time_limit=5)

# Extract results
max_pairwise_selected_colors = [6, 12, 16, 18, 19, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46, 47, 49, 53, 62, 72, 88]
#max_pairwise_selected_colors = max_pairwise_model.analyze_solution(status, solver)
```

```{python}
#| output: false 
# selected_colors.sort(key=lambda c: adjust_hue_for_rainbow(color_df.iloc[c]['Hex']))

# Plot palette and output
max_pairwise_selected_colors.sort(key=lambda c: adjust_hue_for_rainbow(color_df.iloc[c]['Hex']))

display_palette(selected_colors=max_pairwise_selected_colors, color_df=color_df, filepath="assets/max_pairwise_palette.svg")
plot_distance_heatmap(max_pairwise_selected_colors, distance_matrix, color_df, filepath="assets/max_pairwise_heatmap.svg")
```

And we obtain the following palette:

![Color Palette](assets/max_pairwise_palette.svg)

This is a great start! Broadly this palette contains a variety of colors that are quite different. However Charity Pink and Berry are a bit close, so are Maroon and Heather Cardinal as well as Gold and Maize Yellow.

Lets make a heatmap showing how similar/different the colors are and take a closer look:

![Heatmap Showing Pairwise Distances Between Colors](assets/max_pairwise_heatmap.svg)

Interesting. Broadly (see the green in the upper right/lower left), the colors are quite distinct. However along x = -1 (ignoring 0.0 when comparing the same color) some of our colors are almost unacceptably close. 

Maroon and Heather Cardinal are only 6 ∆E units apart, and there are quite a few pairs that are ~10 ∆E units away from each other. 

To solve this issue, instead of maximizing total diversity, what if we tried to maximize the minimum distance between any two colors?

## Maximize the Minimum Distance

We can run a similar optimization to the code above, however we tweak the objective values so we maximize the minimum distance between any two points. 

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| output: true
import random

max_minimum_model = ColorModel(num_colors, num_colors_to_select, distance_matrix)

max_minimum_model.build_max_minimum_model()

max_minimum_colors = [8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 23, 31, 37, 47, 53, 70, 72, 86, 97, 100]

optimal_paletts = max_minimum_model.solve_enumerate_optimal(max_solutions = 100000, known_optimal=22)

max_minimum_colors = random.choice(optimal_paletts)
# max_minimum_colors = max_minimum_model.solve(time_limit=230, log_progress=False)

```

We now obtain a new palette:

```{python}
#|output: false 

max_minimum_colors.sort(key=lambda c: adjust_hue_for_rainbow(color_df.iloc[c]['Hex']))

display_palette(max_minimum_colors, color_df, filepath="assets/max_minimum_palette.svg")

plot_distance_heatmap(max_minimum_colors, distance_matrix, color_df, filepath="assets/max_minimum_heatmap.svg")
```

![Max Min Palette](assets/max_minimum_palette.svg)

And can generate a new heatmap:

![Max Min Heatmap](assets/max_minimum_heatmap.svg)

Much better! Now the closest colors are 22 ∆E units apart, this is a dramatic increase from ∆6 units from before. This palette also includes white, gray, and black, which we were missing before.

Lets take a moment and compare the results of our different objective functions:

### Maxmimize Total Distance

- Colors are broadly more distant (plot is greener)
- Adjacent colors are very close togther
- Solution is FEASIBLE

### Maximize Minimum Distance
![Maximize Minimum Distance Heatmap](assets/max_minimum_heatmap.svg)

- Colors are broadly a little more similar (plot is green/yellow)
- Adjacent colors are much further apart
- Solution is **OPTIMAL**
- 28,654 optimal solutions (for 16 colors)

### Hybrid Approach

Since the solution from the Maximum Minimum approach resulted in a max-min of 22 ∆E units, we can rerun the total distance solver with an additional constraint that all pairs must be a minimum acceptable distance apart. In this case the threshold will be 22 ∆E units. 

After running the solver we get the following result:

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| output: true
#| eval: false 

from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

minimum_acceptable_distance = 22.0

model = cp_model.CpModel()

# x[c] = 1 if color c is selected
x = {c: model.NewBoolVar(f'select_color_{c}') for c in range(num_colors)}

# Constraint: Select exactly n colors
model.Add(sum(x[c] for c in range(num_colors)) == num_colors_to_select)

# Objective: Maximize total pairwise distance
objective_terms = []
for i in range(num_colors):
    for j in range(i + 1, num_colors):
        if (i, j) in distance_matrix:
            dist = distance_matrix[(i, j)]
        elif (j, i) in distance_matrix:
            dist = distance_matrix[(j, i)]
        else:
            continue
        
        # pair_var = 1 if both x[i] and x[j] are selected
        pair_var = model.NewBoolVar(f'pair_{i}_{j}')
        model.AddBoolAnd([x[i], x[j]]).OnlyEnforceIf(pair_var)
        model.AddBoolOr([x[i].Not(), x[j].Not()]).OnlyEnforceIf(pair_var.Not())

        # Threshold constraint: if both selected, distance must be >= minimum
        if dist < minimum_acceptable_distance:
            model.AddBoolOr([x[i].Not(), x[j].Not()])  # Can't select both
        
        objective_terms.append(dist * pair_var)

model.Maximize(sum(objective_terms))

# Solve
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 15  # Optional time limit TODO: CHANGE
solver.parameters.log_search_progress = False 
status = solver.Solve(model)

# Extract results
if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
    selected_colors = [c for c in range(num_colors) if solver.Value(x[c]) == 1]
    
    # Calculate minimum and average distance
    min_found = float('inf')
    total_dist = 0
    count = 0
    for i in selected_colors:
        for j in selected_colors:
            if i < j:
                dist = distance_matrix.get((i, j)) or distance_matrix.get((j, i), 0)
                min_found = min(min_found, dist)
                total_dist += dist
                count += 1
    
    avg_dist = total_dist / count if count > 0 else 0
    print(f"Selected colors: {selected_colors}")
    print(f"Minimum distance: {min_found}")
    print(f"Average distance: {avg_dist}")
    print(f"Status: {'OPTIMAL' if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL else 'FEASIBLE'}")
else:
    print(f"Solver failed with status: {solver.StatusName(status)}")
```

And we obtain the following new palette

```{python}
#|output: false 

# selected_colors.sort(key=lambda c: adjust_hue_for_rainbow(color_df.iloc[c]['Hex']))

# display_palette(selected_colors=selected_colors, color_df=color_df, filepath="assets/hybrid_palette.svg")
```

![Hybrid Algorithm Palette](assets/hybrid_palette.svg)

```{python}
#|output: false 

# plot_distance_heatmap(selected_colors, distance_matrix, color_df, filepath="assets/hybrid_heatmap.svg")
```
